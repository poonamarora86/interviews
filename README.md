### Cisco recommedendation engine

* Situation

I joined to Cisco's marketing data team to help improve marketing processes. One of the common themes of this team was that we used to
help develop data driven campaigns for marketing people. At this time, we used to manually write rules to find relevant people to target.
This was repetative and inefficient process, data wasn't used to its full potential too. Success rate was pretty low (~5% conversion rate)

* Task

I proposed the team to use Machine Learning to automate and generalize this problem. Task was to demonstrate the value of machine learning to Cisco's marketing team by improving customer conversion and at the same time reducing toil on the data team.

* Action

I worked with Head of Marketing to plan a proof of concept. After looking into data sources (marketing history, browsing data, some third party data sources), I built a model to recommend new products to our existing customers. I also deployed the model along with existing campaign development process.
We used model as well as old processes for a few campaigns to A/B test the effectiveness of the model. I also conducted several training sessions and presentations to onboard the data team and explain how model works to marketing team as well.

* Result

Our POC was hugely successful. Customer conversion rate more than doubled. We reached 35% conversion rate for a certain campaigns which wasn't previously achieved. Model was generic enough to run for relatively different types of campaigns. So we reduced a lot of toil on the team. At the end, Marketing team stopped using old processes and exclusively adopted our model based product. We also improved it further by deploying it on the spark and building explanability dashboard to help marketing team self-serve the understanding and impact.

### Barclays ADS program

* Situation

When I joined the Barclays, I was already quite skilled with data science. But to uplift my skills, I joined Barclays ADS program.

* Task

ADS was a year long program to upskill my data science knowledge by working on a project that impacts Barclays business. Just to be clear, this was extra work outside our normal projects.

* Action

Not only I finished the ADS course but also built a general purpose LookALike model that got used in a few Barclays use cases. Some of which in different teams. We used my ADS project to improve Barclays aquisition propositions such as money mentors and smart start etc.

After that, I also wanted to help others to go through this program to improve data science skillset in the Barclays. I became ADS mentor for one of the follow up batches, co-built interview questions and evaluation criteria, presented on various topics in the program, helped several people in choosing and finishing their ADS project alongwith normal mentorship.

* Result

This not only helped me dig deeper in the data science techniques, practices, improved my mentorship and interpersonal skills but my involvement also helped several other people to upskill their data science knowledge. This in turn helped Barclays business because all these people now will apply these techniques to solve (or improve existing solutions) to their respective business verticals.
